Meal Planner is a project to help people plan their meals.  
Additionally, Meal Planner needs a better name.

There are three parts to Meal Planner:

 * a recipe database
 * a calendar that organizes meals
 * a grocery list

The idea is simply a drag-and-drop interface (like you can move around 
widgets in iGoogle) for recipes onto a calendar.  Recipes are in a 
list on the left-hand side.  Calendar is in the center.  Grocery list
is on the right-hand side.

The model is incomplete, and still under development.  Any help 
developing or designing would be greatly appreciated.
